# Artha-X Financial Agent Application (arthax)

Artha-X is a web-based financial agent application designed to provide a user interface for financial interactions and data presentation. It serves as the front-end component of a larger financial management system, handling user requests and displaying processed information.

## Features

* **Web-based Interface**: Accessible via a browser.
* **User Interaction**: Designed to handle user inputs and requests for financial operations.
* **Data Presentation**: Displays financial data and analysis results in a user-friendly format.
* **Modular Design**: Structured to integrate with backend services for complex financial logic.

## Project Structure

The `arthax` directory is organized as follows:

arthax/
├── app.py              # The main Flask application entry point.
├── requirements.txt    # Lists all Python dependencies for the application.
└── templates/          # Contains Jinja2 HTML templates for the web interface.
    └── index.html      # The main HTML template for the application's home page.


## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Flask**: A micro web framework for building the web application.
* **Jinja2**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For front-end structure, styling, and interactivity.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the `arthax` application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    If you haven't already, clone the `agentXcelerate` repository which contains the `arthax` application:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/tharunsajjanam/agentXcelerate.git](https://github.com/tharunsajjanam/agentXcelerate.git)
    cd agentXcelerate
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the `arthax` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd arthax
    ```

3.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

4.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    * On Linux/macOS:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

5.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the `arthax` Flask application:

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2.  **Set the Flask application environment variable:**
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    ```
    (On Windows, use `set FLASK_APP=app.py`)

3.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

    The application will typically be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.
